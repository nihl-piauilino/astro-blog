# Astro's Tutorial Blog
This project is a [tutorial at Astro's oficial website](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) to teach the basics concepts and firsts steps of the framework.

## What was built?
The final product is a blog with some mocked up posts, but fully functional, including tags to filter content, togglable dark/light theme, navigation menu, responsive layout and some interactivity. You can check mine at [this link](https://np-astro-blog.netlify.app/);
